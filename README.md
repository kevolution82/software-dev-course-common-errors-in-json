Fixes and Explanations
Missing comma after "checkInDate"
What was wrong: There was no comma after the "checkInDate" line.
Why it matters: JSON requires commas between key-value pairs. Without the comma, the parser gets confused and can’t separate one entry from the next.
Fix: Added a comma after "checkInDate": "2024-05-15".

Unquoted key: name in the first guest object
What was wrong: The key name was not in double quotes..
Why it matters: JSON demands that all keys be strings wrapped in double quotes.
Fix: Changed name: "Alice Johnson" to "name": "Alice Johnson".

Invalid value: undefined for Bob’s age
What was wrong: undefined is not a valid JSON data type.
Why it matters: JSON supports null but does not support undefined — that’s a JavaScript thing.
Fix: Replaced undefined with null.

Trailing comma in "amenities" array
What was wrong: There was an extra comma after the last array item "Parking".
Why it matters: JSON does not allow trailng commas in arrays or objects.
Fix: Removed the comma after "Parking".

Follow-Up Questions
What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?
I used a combination of visual inspection (with syntax highlighting in the editor) and a JSON validator (JSONLint). The validator flagged the first error, and once that was fixed, it helped me uncover the rest.

How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?
I pasted the final version into JSONLint and ran validation. It returned no errors.

Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?
The missing comma after "checkInDate" was the trickiest. It blended in visually with the rest of the code and didn’t stand out until the validator pointed me in that direction.

What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
Use an editor with real-time linting and auto-formatting. Validate often as you build. Don’t paste in JSON from JavaScript or other languages without cleaning it up. And structure your objects in chunks, testing as you go. JSON breaks fast when you rush it.
